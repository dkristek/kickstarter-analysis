# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
  This project analyzes the outcomes of various Kicstarter campaigns. The project looks at the outcome of theater based Kickstarter campaigns based on the launch date. It also looks at the outcome of campaigns based on the financial goal of the campaign at launch. The purpose of this analysis was to provide more information on the success of campaigns to a client who had recently ran a failed Kickstarter campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The client had recently ran a campaign for a play that ended up failing. So they had an interest in seeing how other Theater campaigns had fared. A pivot table was used to create a line graph showing the amount of the different outcomes of Theater Kickstarter campaigns vs the month of the campaign's launch. From the graph, it is observed that the month of launch and the amount of canceled campaigns do not seem to share an association. It is also clear that May, June, and July have the most amount of succesful Kickstarter launches.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This part of the analysis looks at how the set financial goal at launch impacts the outcome of the campaign. The percentage of failures, cancellations, and successes were calculated with different ranges of financial goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
