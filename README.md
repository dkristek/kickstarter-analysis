# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
  This project analyzes the outcomes of various Kicstarter campaigns. The project looks at the outcome of theater based Kickstarter campaigns based on the launch date. It also looks at the outcome of campaigns based on the financial goal of the campaign at launch. The purpose of this analysis was to provide more information on the success of campaigns to a client who had recently ran a failed Kickstarter campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The client had recently ran a campaign for a play that ended up failing. So they had an interest in seeing how other Theater campaigns had fared. A pivot table was used to create a line graph showing the amount of the different outcomes of Theater Kickstarter campaigns vs the month of the campaign's launch. From the graph, it is observed that the month of launch and the amount of canceled campaigns do not seem to share an association. It is also clear that May, June, and July have the most amount of succesful Kickstarter launches.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This part of the analysis looks at how the set financial goal at launch impacts the outcome of the campaign. The percentage of failures, cancellations, and successes were calculated with different ranges of financial goals. From the graph it is observed that a higher goal tends to work against the campaign. The success percentage goes down at higher goals while the failed and canceled perecentages increase.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While no difficulties or challenges were encountered during the analyis we will discuss possible issues that could arise. Challenges could have come in the form of the data not showing any trends. If the charts used did not show trends we would proceed by approaching the data with different analytical methods. Other tables and graphs that could be applied to the data are addressed in the results section.
## Results
From the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date graph, it is possible to conclude that Theater kickstarter campaigns have the most success when launching between the months of May and July. We also came to the conclusion that the month of launch does not prove to have a significant association with the number of canceled kickstarter campaigns. 

From the Outcome Based on Goals analysis it can be concluded that campaigns that launched with a goal of less than $5000 tended to have best outcomes (high successes and low cancellations/failures). Generally speaking, the higher the goal is the more likely it is that the outcome was negative (failed or canceled). 

While this dataset includes a few thousand campaigns it is still just a very small portion of the total Kickstarter campaigns. Without knowing how this data was collected and how the campaigns were chosen it is possible that the dataset does not accurately represent the population of all Kickstarter campaigns. It is possible that the campaigns were not randomly selected and could possibly have a selection bias.

There are a variety of different graphs and tables that could be of interest to the client. For theater specific data we could look at country of origin vs outcome. This would show whether theater campaigns do better in specific regions. It might also be of interest to look at average donor amount vs outcome and average donation amount vs outcome, for both theater campaigns and all campaigns. Looking at these two statistics could grant the client insight into the scale or reach of theater campaigns. Are the successful theater campaigns getting lots of small donations from a large number of people? Are they getting large donations from a small amount of people?

    It could also be interesting to look at the campaign being featured in the spotlight vs outcome and the campaign being a staff pick vs outcomes. This could show a possible association between these two ways of highlighting a kickstarter campaign and the success of the campaign.
